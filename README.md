# Secure P2P Chat

This is another one of my random projects that I threw together in a random morning/afternoon

## QuickStart

### First Run

`npm run all`

### After First Run

`npm run start`

### Instructions

`/listen [port]` -- Host a chat. Port is optional
`/connect host:port` -- Connect to someone else's chat session
`/su newUsername` -- Change username from your session/computer username to something else
